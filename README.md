This is a re-build of [GrixusVisionFrontend](https://github.com/hikemalliday/GrixusVisionFrontend). The prupose of the rebuild was to:

- Learn `react-query`
- Attempt to build without looking at past projects for reference / copypaste.

I did fairly well on not looking at past projects for the most part (forced me to dive deeper into docs and actually understand what I was doing), but I got stuck on the Axios Interceptors + the resolution of tokens + auth and such, but put in a solid effort before opening up an old project to figure out what I did wrong.
